CCNprotocol
===========

CCN (Content-Centric Networking) protocol description and verification in Coq (Tested by Coq 8.4 pl6)

## Files

There are 10 main files and 6 examples.

* MiscSpec.v : some lemmas for lists/options used in proofs, but not defined in standard libraries.
* CCNTopology.v : module-type for network topology
* CCNProtocol.v : CCN protocol definition for the topology
* CCNProtocolLemma.v : some lemmas for the protocol
* CCNVerification.v : main specifications for CCN protocol and proofs of them
* CCNProtocolOrthogonality.v : filtering events for specific content
* CCNContentManagement.v : module-type for content management function
* CCNProtocolWithCM.v : CCN protocol definition with content management
* CCNProtocolLemmaWithCM.v : some lemmas for the protocol with content management
* CCNVerificationWithCM.v : main specifications for CCN protocol and proofs
* CCNLine.v : instance of network topology, half-line
* CCNTree.v : instance of network topology, binary-tree
* CCNSimpleNetwork.v : instance of network topology, 7 nodes
* CCNSimpleNetworkFIFO.v : instance of content management function with CCNSimpleNetwork.v (FIFO)
* CCNSimpleNetworkFIFOMixed.v : instance of content management function with CCNSimpleNetwork.v (Mixed with FIFO and No-limit strage)
* CCNSimpleNetworkLRU.v : instance of content management function with CCNSimpleNetwork.v (Least Recently Used strategy)


## Build

Install Coq 8.4 pl6 (maybe any version of 8.4 can be used, but not tested by 8.5) and use "make" command.
Makefile is generated by coq_makefile (with little modification).
For documents, "make html" or "make gallinahtml" can be used.
